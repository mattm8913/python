-to pass a value into a string or print statement, use:
'{}'.format(value)
-to display that value within the string as a float number with a specific number of decimal places (ex:2):
'{.2f}'.format(value)

-To execute a script/module from the IDLE environment, ensure the script executes from a "main()" function.

import script_name

script_name.main()

-OR just have the entire script without a main function, just run
import script_name

-Python install location:
C:\Users\Matt\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\

-Python scripts executable from a command line prompt:
C:\Users\Matt\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts

-to alter Python's default paths, create a new environmental variable called PYTHONPATH, and place 
inside it all the path locations that you want python to search.  (In windows, those are separated
by ";", otherwise, by ",")

-You can also pernanently alter the sys.path list by going to 
C:\Users\Matt\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages
-and creating a new file called "my-paths.pth"
-each line of that file should contain a path that you want to add to sys.path
